The actual number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.

With N95 masks swinging from their duty belts and disposable blue gloves hanging out of their back pockets, America\\'s first responders are in uniform and at work during this pandemic.

Just walking up a few stairs leaves his short of breath, and he\\'s worried his residual cough might infect his partner. But he felt guilty sitting on the sidelines while his comrades struggled. Custody assistant Sonia Munoz is sure she contracted the virus at Los Angeles\\' Twin Towers Correctional Facility. And she thinks she took it home to her father.

Order Now\\n\\nNEW YORK: Everyone wants to know: When, oh when, will it go back to normal? As some governors across the United States begin to ease restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus , hopes are soaring that life as Americans knew it might be returning.But plans emerging in many states indicate that “normal” is still a long way off.White House adviser Dr. Deborah Birx says social distancing will be with Americans through the summer. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards warns of a “different way of life” until there is a widely available vaccine — maybe not until next year.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says: \"There is no return to yesterday in life.”From the beginning, the pandemic forced impossible choices: physical health or mental health? Economic well-being or medical safety? Most states joined the world and turned the dial down hard, closing shops and restaurants, factories and schools.Asking people to largely keep to their homes. Now, the dial is beginning to inch in the opposite direction.In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp is pushing one of the most aggressive reopening plans in the United States.Barbershops, gyms and nail salons were allowed to reopen Friday, and dine-in restaurant service and movie screenings were freed to resume Monday — despite warnings that, without sufficient testing, the state could see a surge in infections.Even there, though, life was far from normal Monday. Patrons went to restaurants with X\\'s on some tables, chatted across the room to one another and gave orders to servers whose faces were covered by masks.Draft guidance for reopening from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided more evidence Monday that “normal\" would not be on the menu — at restaurants or anywhere else.No break rooms for employees and no field trips for school children, the guidelines recommended. Children should eat in their classrooms, not the cafeteria, and congregants should stay 6 feet apart in church.In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan envisions a phased reopening — something the federal government also advocates.First small shops could open, and some outdoor recreation could resume, then perhaps restaurants and bars. Phase three, which the administration cautions it has no realistic time frame for reaching, would allow larger social gatherings and high-capacity bars, restaurants and entertainment venues could reopen.You know, the stuff that two months ago might have just been called “city life.”Even with strict rules in place, it\\'s a delicate dance, as Dennis McKinley learned this weekend.He had planned to open two of the three branches of his restaurant, The Original Hot Dog Factory, for dine-in service in the Atlanta area. He reversed himself Monday after getting about 40 calls from politicians, community leaders and customers urging him to keep diners out.“Ultimately, The Original Hot Dog Factory can\\'t make it without the community\\'s support, so I felt it was important to hold back and wait,” McKinley said.What he calls community support, economists might refer to as confidence. Economies run on that, especially the American one, in which consumer spending accounts for 70% of all activity. When people are scared or times uncertain, they tend not to shell out.“After an initial pop to growth, when businesses do reopen, it\\'s going to be a slog until there\\'s a vaccine,” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody\\'s Analytics.“I think there\\'s going to be a lot of cautious people and therefore a lot of cautious businesses.\"For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death.And while many point to a vaccine as the surest path to normal, public health experts see another way that\\'s no less daunting: millions more tests, 100,000 or more health workers to track and isolate those exposed to COVID-19, and a seamless data network to coordinate the effort.The US is far from implementing any of this. So in the absence of a vaccine or other reassuring measures — and in the face of a threat that is largely invisible — how will Americans believe that it\\'s safe to go out again? “You know when a flood is there and when it\\'s gone,” says Steven Taylor, a professor at The University of British Columbia who wrote “The Psychology of Pandemics.”',\n",

The manufacturing of the vaccines has also been disrupted, creating additional shortages,” says Paul Rutter, Regional Health Advisor for UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA).Many of the health facilities throughout the region, where millions of children are normally vaccinated, have been closed and outreach sessions have been suspended, adding to the challenge.South Asia could face yet another health emergency if children across the region do not receive their life-saving vaccine shots, the UNICEF said.“As long as frontline health workers take the appropriate precautions, particularly washing their hands, there is no reason not to vaccinate – in fact, it is crucial that vaccination continues,” says Rutter.Across the region, national mass vaccination campaigns have been postponed. Bangladesh and Nepal have postponed their national measles and rubella campaigns while Pakistan and Afghanistan have suspended their polio campaigns.The UNICEF strongly recommends that, where immunization campaigns are suspended, governments begin rigorous planning now to intensify immunization activities once the Covid -19 pandemic is under control.“We are very concerned about the impact of not getting children vaccinated,” says Jean Gough, Director of UNICEF ROSA\",\n",

Order Now\\n\\nLONDON: A contact-tracing smartphone application which alerts the users of a possible coronavirus case among their recent communications will be ready for use within two to three weeks, British MPs were told on Tuesday.The voluntary app, developed by NHSX, the digital arm of the UK\\'s state-funded National Health Service (NHS), will first be trialled in a small region and then rolled out further based on results, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee was told.NHSX chief executive Matthew Gould also stressed that the team had built in a series of measures to reassure people about privacy fears.\"We are going as fast as we can, we have teams of people looking at it 24/7,” said Gould.\"We are, I hope, on course to have the app ready for when it will be needed, for the moment when the country looks to have the tools to come out of lockdown safely,\" he said.The app will work by using a smartphone\\'s Bluetooth technology to keep an anonymous record of other smartphone users they come into close proximity with. Gould told MPs that the UK\\'s approach had \"a measure of centralisation\" as it would be the NHS which sends the alerts to the users.\"We don\\'t believe that\\'s a privacy endangering step. But also, by doing so, it allows you to see the contact graph of how this is propagating and how the contacts are working across a number of individuals, without knowing who they are,\" he said.Earlier in a blog post explaining the app, Gould had noted that the app could be important in helping the country return to \"normality\" and beating the coronavirus as it forms part of a wider approach that will involve contact tracing and testing.The technology is based on research evidence developed by epidemiologists, mathematical modellers and ethicists at Oxford University \\'s Nuffield Departments of Medicine and Population Health Once the app is installed, it will start logging the distance between your phone and other phones nearby that also have the app installed using Bluetooth Low Energy.\"This anonymous log of how close you are to others will be stored securely on your phone. If you become unwell with symptoms of COVID-19, you can choose to allow the app to inform the NHS which, subject to sophisticated risk analysis, will trigger an anonymous alert to those other app users with whom you came into significant contact over the previous few days,\" NHSX notes.The app will advise you what action to take if you have been close to someone who has become symptomatic – including advising you to self-isolate if necessary.\"There\\'s an intrinsic risk in building any kind of centralised index of the movement of the entire population which might be retained in some form beyond the pandemic,\" professor Lilian Edwards , an expert in internet law at Newcastle University , told MPs.She said that the centralised approach raised questions about privacy.But Gould insisted that the range of protections in place will overcome these concerns.',\n",

Anadolu Agency said the attack in a crowded street in Afrin was carried out using a fuel tanker. It said several others were wounded.The agency quoted unnamed security officials as saying the attack was believed to have been carried out by Syrian Kurdish fighters linked to Kurdish militants fighting Turkey.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , an opposition war monitor, said the blast occurred in a market killing 20 and wounding 27 others.The Qasioun news agency, an activist collective, said the blast killed 42 and wounded more than 50.Turkey and allied Syrian fighters took control of Afrin in 2018 in a military operation that expelled local Kurdish fighters and displaced thousands of Kurdish residents. Ankara considers the Kurdish fighters who were in control of Afrin to be terrorists. Since then, there have been a series of attacks on Turkish targets in the area.Similar blasts in areas controlled by Turkey-backed opposition fighters have killed scores of people in recent months, attacks that Ankara blames on Kurdish fighters.Turkey supports the Syrian opposition in the war against President Bashar Assad but has joined with Russia to secure and monitor local cease-fires.Activist collectives in northern Syria urged people in the Afrin area to head to hospitals and donate blood.The Observatory and other activists said the death toll could rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition.\",\n",

Several are closed to foreigners and even Russians require special clearance to enter them as facilities located there are closely guarded secrets.Rosatom chief Alexei Likhachev said special deliveries of ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE) were being sent to the closed town of Sarov, east of Moscow , and other towns where dozens of cases of the virus have been registered.\"This (pandemic) creates a direct threat to our nuclear towns. The situation in Sarov, Elektrostal, Desnogorsk is today particularly alarming,\" he said in an online speech to Russia\\'s nuclear industry workers.\"The situation in Sarov is exacerbated by an outbreak of the illness in the nearby Diveyevo monastery,\" he said, without elaborating further.Likhachev made his remarks on a day when Russia reported its biggest daily rise in new coronavirus cases. Russia now ranks eighth worldwide with 93,558 confirmed cases, though its death toll of 867 is still far below that of many other nations.Moscow, which accounts for more than half of Russia\\'s cases, and many other regions of the vast nation have imposed stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of the virus.SECRETSarov, which was so secret that it did not appear on maps until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, remains an important part of Russia\\'s nuclear military complex, defence experts say.It is home to a research institute that gained prominence last year when five of its scientists died in a mysterious accident at a military testing site in the far north.Rosatom said the incident had occurred during a rocket engine test on a sea platform. Some U.S. experts said they suspected it had been a botched test of a new missile vaunted by President Vladimir Putin Last week, Rosatom said seven people at Sarov\\'s All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics had been diagnosed with coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the city of around 95,000 to 23.It said the outbreak in Sarov had begun when a retired couple returned to the city from a Russian holiday resort and that more than 100 people had since been isolated to stop it spreading further.',\n",

              "  'Text': 'WASHINGTON: An Indian-American NGO has raised $1 million to fight hunger in India and the United States amid the the coronavirus pandemic.This translates to 4,700,000 meals for people in the United States and ration kits for 106,000 migrant workers in India that will last them seven to 10 days, said M R Rangaswami, founder and chairman of the board of NGO Indiaspora It was a volunteer group in San Jose, California that made the last donation of $5,000 after which the campaign fund crossed $1 million.“It is so heartening to see that this is just a group of regular Indian Americans, who are a volunteer group, and are gifting to different non-profits and charities. They on their own decided that this was the best cause,” Rangaswami, an investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist, told PTI.The money raised by Indiaspora through its \\'ChaloGive for COVID-19 \\' online campaign will be used to provide relief directly to vulnerable population in both the countries.Contributions given are sent to two beneficiary organisations, Feeding America in the US and Goonj in India.Feeding America is using the contributions to bolster its nationwide network of 200 food banks. Goonj is using the funds to provide food, dry ration and hygiene kits to displaced migrants in parts of eighteen states in India.In this hour of coronavirus pandemic that has hit both the United States and India, the Indian-American community has resoundingly shown up across the country, said Rangaswami.“It\\'s not just donations to Indiaspora. The Sikhs feeding people through langar, young children making masks for healthcare workers, SEWA International making plasma donation matching. It has been an outpouring from across the country, which I have never seen before,” said the California-based venture capitalist, who has closely following communities\\' philanthropic activities for long time.Such an outpouring of support was last time seen during the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, but that time the call was given by the then US President Bill Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he said.“Since then, I have not seen anything of this scale (of giving by Indian-Americans),” he said, adding that the community this time is contributing both their time and money.SEWA International, another non-profit body has raised more than $500,000 for its coronavirus relief work.One of the donations that helped Indiaspora cross the $1 million threshold came from Bay-area based volunteer group Aram Sei, whose vision is to support grassroots charities worldwide in the areas of education and healthcare.“Our team of twelve members is proud to support the ChaloGive fundraiser initiative that helps us make a direct impact to those in need,” said Sangeetha Lakshminarayanan, president and founder of Aram Sei.“We feel fortunate to be able to make a difference in our country of origin and the country we have embraced and made our home,” she said.“There was a huge desire in our community to help during this crisis, and we provided an easy way to give. The Indian diaspora stood up and rose to the occasion when the ultimate time of reckoning arrived,” said Indiaspora\\'s executive director, Sanjeev Joshipura.“We want to do everything we can to help our country of birth and our country of citizenship. It is not either or, it is US and India,” he added.On Thursday, Indiaspora also added new partnerships for the ChaloGive campaign.In addition to former Pepsico CEO Indra Nooyi, noted philanthropists Rohini and Nandan Nilekani, former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and actor Nandita Das, all existing \\'ChaloGive for COVID-19\\' Ambassadors, Indiaspora announced the addition of GiveIndia CEO Atul Satija, and Raj and Aradhana (Anna) Asava, the pioneers of the \\'HungerMitao\\' (wipe out hunger) movement in America.\"Having enabled over 10 million meals to-date, HungerMitao is proud to partner with Indiaspora to raise funds for the food challenged in this time of crisis,” said Raj and Anna Asava, who both have a successful track record of partnering with food banks across North America.“HungerMitao is a grassroots initiative engaging the Indian-American community in the fight against hunger through the Feeding America network of food banks,\" he said.\"Just as India\\'s social indices had begun to improve, coronavirus threatens to bring 80 per cent of India\\'s working population - the informal sector - to its knees,” said Atul Satija, founder of India\\'s largest donation platform, and Indiaspora\\'s India partner for ChaloGive.\"We appeal to the huge Indian diaspora to support the immediate needs of hunger and reviving livelihoods before they fall back into extreme poverty, and rebuilding the lives of the less fortunate in the longer term,\" he said.The campaign at ChaloGive.org continues, with a live Facebook rally planned on May 4 at 9 pm EST/6 pm PST on the eve of Giving Tuesday for Covid-19, a media release said.ChaloGive for Covid-19 is the second online campaign by Indiaspora. Its inaugural campaign was launched on October 2, 2019 on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and concluded on October 8.It highlighted more than 20 organisations with successful track records in areas of poverty alleviation and empowerment, health, and education.',\n",
